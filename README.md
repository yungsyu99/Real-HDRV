## Download dataset
We provide the original raw data to facilitate the research on HDR imaging. Since our dataset is collected from RAW domain, the data processing is highly flexible. The researchers can organize the RAW data according to their tasks to generate the desired datasets.
Here, we provide the pre-generated datasets for HDR video reconstrcution (2 alternating exposures with 3 EV stops) and HDR deghosting.
